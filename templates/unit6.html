                    Unit 6: Integration and Accumulation of Change
                    I. Antiderivatives & Indefinite Integrals
                    An antiderivative F of a function f is a differentiable function whose derivative is equal to the
                    original function f. If $F '(x) = f(x)$, then we say that F is an antiderivative of f.

                    An indefinite integral of a function f is a family of functions F that are antiderivatives of f.

                    $$ \int f(x) dx = F(x) + C + D $$

                    C represents the constant of integration, which accounts for the entire family of solutions.

                    II. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
                    The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

                    If a function f is continuous on the interval [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f on an interval
                    containing [a,b], then

                    $$ \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
                    $$

                    The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

                    If f is a function continuous on an open interval I containing a, then, for every x in the interval,

                    $$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x) $$

                    III. Definite Integrals
                    The definite integral of a function f from a to b is the signed area between the x-axis and the
                    graph of the function from x=a to x=b.

                    $$ \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

                    Note: If f(x) is greater than 0 for all x in the interval [a,b], then $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is the
                    exact area under the curve y=f(x) from x=a to x=b. If f(x) is less than 0, then the "area" is taken
                    as negative.

                    Properties of Definite Integrals:

                    $\int_a^a f(x) dx = 0$
                    $\int_a^b f(x) dx = -\int_b^a f(x) dx$
                    $\int_a^b (f(x)±g(x)) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx ± \int_a^b g(x) dx$
                    $\int_a^b (cf(x)) dx = c \int_a^b f(x) dx$ (c is a constant)
                    IV. Accumulation Functions
                    An accumulation function is a function defined by an integral with variable limits:

                    $$ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt $$

                    where f(t) is a continuous function on an interval I containing a.

                    V. Techniques of Integration
                    1. Substitution (u-substitution):

                    If g’ is continuous on [a,b] and f is continuous on the range of u=g(x), then

                    $$ \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) du $$

                    It allows us to transform the integral of a complex function into an integral that is easier to
                    evaluate.

                    2. Integration By Parts:

                    $$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$

                    It is useful when the integral is a product of two functions; one that is easily integrable after
                    differentiation and another that simplifies upon differentiation.

                    3. Partial Fractions:

                    When integrating a rational function, where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of
                    the denominator, it can be useful to express the integrand as a sum of partial fractions. You can
                    then integrate term by term.

                    VI. Improper Integrals
                    An improper integral is the limit of a definite integral as an endpoint of the interval of
                    integration approaches either a specified real number, or ∞, or −∞. It can also be due to
                    discontinuities in the function.

                    Example:

                    $$ \int_a^∞ f(x) dx = \lim_{b\to∞} \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

                    For this to be defined, the limit must exist.
