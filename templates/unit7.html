                <h1>AP Calculus BC - Unit 7: Differential Equations</h1>

                <h2>7.1 Modeling Situations with Differential Equations</h2>
                <p>Understanding how to represent real-world scenarios using differential equations. A differential
                    equation expresses a relationship involving rates of change and the functions they affect.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Consider a population growing at a rate proportional to its size. This can be modeled by the
                    differential equation \( \frac{dP}{dt} = kP \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The solution to this differential equation is \( P(t) = P_0 e^{kt} \),
                    where \( P_0 \) is the initial population and \( k \) is the growth constant.</p>

                <h2>7.2 Verifying Solutions for Differential Equations</h2>
                <p>You’ll need to determine whether a given function satisfies a given differential equation.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Verify that \( y = e^{4x} \) is a solution to the differential equation \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 4y \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compute \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 4e^{4x} \). Since \( 4e^{4x} = 4y \), the
                    function \( y = e^{4x} \) satisfies the differential equation.</p>

                <h2>7.3 Sketching Slope Fields</h2>
                <p>A slope field is a graphical representation of a differential equation, showing the direction of the
                    tangent lines at various points.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Sketch a slope field for \( \frac{dy}{dx} = x - y \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Calculate the slopes at points on a grid, e.g., at (1,1), \( \frac{dy}{dx}
                    = 1-1 = 0 \); at (0,0), \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 0-0 = 0 \); at (2,1), \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 2-1 = 1 \), etc.
                    Draw small line segments with these slopes at the respective points.</p>

                <h2>7.4 Finding General Solutions using Separation of Variables</h2>
                <p>Solve differential equations by separating variables and integrating each side.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Solve \( \frac{dy}{dx} = y \cdot \cos(x) \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Separate variables: \( \frac{dy}{y} = \cos(x) \, dx \). Integrate both
                    sides: \( \ln|y| = \sin(x) + C \). Solve for y: \( y = Ce^{\sin(x)} \).</p>

                <h2>7.5 Finding Particular Solutions using Initial Conditions</h2>
                <p>Use an initial condition to find the particular solution for a differential equation.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Solve \( \frac{dy}{dx} = xy \) with initial condition \( y(0) = 3 \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Separate: \( \frac{dy}{y} = x \, dx \). Integrate: \( \ln|y| =
                    \frac{x^2}{2} + C \). Solve for y: \( y = Ce^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \). Use initial condition: \( 3 = Ce^0
                    \rightarrow C = 3 \). Therefore, \( y = 3e^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \).</p>

                <h2>7.6 Exponential Growth and Decay</h2>
                <p>Modeling scenarios where a quantity grows or decays at a rate proportional to its size.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>P(t) = P<sub>0</sub>e<sup>kt</sup> models population growth.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For a population of 100 growing at 5% per year: \( P(t) = 100e^{0.05t} \).
                </p>

                <h2>7.7 Logistic Growth Models</h2>
                <p>Modeling scenarios with a carrying capacity, where growth slows as population size approaches the
                    carrying capacity.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>The logistic model is \( P(t) = \frac{K}{1 + \left( \frac{K - P_0}{P_0} \right)e^{-rt}} \).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For a population with carrying capacity 500, initial population 10, and
                    growth rate 0.1: \( P(t) = \frac{500}{1 + 49e^{-0.1t}} \).</p>

                <h2>7.8 Euler’s Method</h2>
                <p>A numerical approach to solving differential equations.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Using Euler’s Method with step size 0.1 to approximate y(0.5) given \( y' = y + x \) and y(0) = 1.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Step 1: \( y_1 = y_0 + f(x_0, y_0)\Delta x = 1 + (1+0) \cdot 0.1 = 1.1 \).
                    Continue stepping forward to approximate y(0.5).</p>

                <h2>7.9 Analytical, Numerical, and Graphical Approaches</h2>
                <p>Solving differential equations using various methods: exact solutions, approximations, and
                    visualizations.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>Compare exact, Euler, and slope field methods on \( \frac{dy}{dx} = x + y \) with y(0)=1.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Exact: \( y = Ce^x - x - 1 \). Euler and slope field as described in
                    respective sections.</p>
