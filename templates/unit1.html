                    Unit 1 of AP Calculus BC covers the topic of Limits and Continuity. This foundational unit provides
                    essential concepts for understanding calculus.

                    Limit and Continuity Notes

                    The concept of a limit is foundational in calculus. When we say the limit of a function as x
                    approaches a certain value, we are referring to the value the function approaches as the inputs get
                    arbitrarily close to that value.

                    The formal definition of a limit is as follows:

                    $$ \lim_{{x\to a}}f(x) = L $$

                    This implies that the values of f(x) approach L as x approaches a.

                    For example, consider the function $$f(x) = x^2$$ and we want to find the limit as x approaches 2.
                    We would say that:

                    $$ \lim_{{x\to 2}} x^2 = 4 $$

                    Because the values of x^2 get arbitrarily close to 4 as x gets arbitrarily close to 2.

                    Continuity is a related concept. A function is considered continuous if it has no jumps, breaks, or
                    holes. More formally, a function $$f(x)$$ is continuous at $$x = a$$ if

                    $$ \lim_{{x\to a}}f(x) = f(a) $$

                    That is, the value of the function at a is equal to the limit of the function as x approaches a.

                    We can use the concepts of limits and continuity to understand and evaluate complex functions. For
                    example, we can use the limit definition:

                    $$ \lim_{{h\to 0}} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} $$

                    To calculate the derivative of a function at a point a, which provides us with the rate of change of
                    the function at that point.

                    Another important theorem relating limits and continuity is the Intermediate Value Theorem. This
                    theorem states that if a function f is continuous on the interval [a,b] and k is any number between
                    f(a) and f(b), then there is at least one number c in the interval [a,b] such that f(c) = k.

                    In other words, if we draw a line from (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)), the line will pass through every y
                    value between f(a) and f(b). This gives us a way to solve for values in the range of a continuous
                    function.

                    Unit 1 in AP Calculus BC also covers special cases of limits and continuity, including the concept
                    of limits at infinity, and the behavior of functions around holes and vertical asymptotes.

                    The limit as x approaches infinity (or negative infinity) refers to the behavior of a function as
                    its inputs get arbitrarily large (or large in the negative direction). The notation for this is:

                    $$ \lim_{{x\to \infty}}f(x) = L $$

                    A function may have a hole at a certain point if the function is undefined at that point, but
                    defined everywhere else nearby. An asymptote is a line that a graph approaches but never touches.

                    All these concepts together provide a strong foundation to proceed to the subsequent units that deal
                    with differentiation and integration, which are the building blocks of calculus. Recall these
                    concepts, know how to apply them, and understand their diagrams and graphical representations will
                    be indeed helpful for your AP Calculess BC exam. Good luck.
