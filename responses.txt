1. Antiderivatives An antiderivative of a function f is a differentiable function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f.

In other words, if F’(x) = f(x), then F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x).

2. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the integral of a function.

2.1 First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: If a function f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], then:

$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$

2.2 Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: If f is a function that is continuous over an interval I containing the number a, then:

$\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x)$

3. Definite Integrals The definite integral of f from a to b, is the signed area between f and the x-axis, from a to b.

$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$

4. Indefinite Integrals An indefinite integral, also known as an antiderivative, of a function f is a function whose derivative is f.

$\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C$

where, C is the constant of integration.

5. Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus If a function f is defined on an interval [a, b] and F is the antiderivative of f on [a, b], then F is differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and F'(x) = f(x) for all x in (a, b).

6. Integration using Substitution The method of substitution is used to turn a difficult integration problem into an easier one.

If u = g(x) is a differentiable function whose range is an interval I and f is continuous on I, then:

$\int f(g(x)) g'(x) dx = \int f(u) du$

7. Transcendental Functions Transcendental functions include exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. These functions have their unique integration formulas.

Unit 6: Integration and Accumulation of Change
I. Antiderivatives & Indefinite Integrals
An antiderivative F of a function f is a differentiable function whose derivative is equal to the original function f. If $F '(x) = f(x)$, then we say that F is an antiderivative of f.

An indefinite integral of a function f is a family of functions F that are antiderivatives of f.

$$ \int f(x) dx = F(x) + C $$

C represents the constant of integration, which accounts for the entire family of solutions.

II. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

If a function f is continuous on the interval [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f on an interval containing [a,b], then

$$ \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

If f is a function continuous on an open interval I containing a, then, for every x in the interval,

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x) $$

III. Definite Integrals
The definite integral of a function f from a to b is the signed area between the x-axis and the graph of the function from x=a to x=b.

$$ \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

Note: If f(x) is greater than 0 for all x in the interval [a,b], then $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is the exact area under the curve y=f(x) from x=a to x=b. If f(x) is less than 0, then the "area" is taken as negative.

Properties of Definite Integrals:

$\int_a^a f(x) dx = 0$
$\int_a^b f(x) dx = -\int_b^a f(x) dx$
$\int_a^b (f(x)±g(x)) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx ± \int_a^b g(x) dx$
$\int_a^b (cf(x)) dx = c \int_a^b f(x) dx$ (c is a constant)
IV. Accumulation Functions
An accumulation function is a function defined by an integral with variable limits:

$$ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt $$

where f(t) is a continuous function on an interval I containing a.

V. Techniques of Integration
1. Substitution (u-substitution):

If g’ is continuous on [a,b] and f is continuous on the range of u=g(x), then

$$ \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) du $$

It allows us to transform the integral of a complex function into an integral that is easier to evaluate.

2. Integration By Parts:

$$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$

It is useful when the integral is a product of two functions; one that is easily integrable after differentiation and another that simplifies upon differentiation.

3. Partial Fractions:

When integrating a rational function, where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, it can be useful to express the integrand as a sum of partial fractions. You can then integrate term by term.

VI. Improper Integrals
An improper integral is the limit of a definite integral as an endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified real number, or ∞, or −∞. It can also be due to discontinuities in the function.

Example:

$$ \int_a^∞ f(x) dx = \lim_{b\to∞} \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

For this to be defined, the limit must exist.

These are the primary topics for Unit 6. Be sure to practice a variety of problems dealing with each type of integration in order to cement your understanding. Good luck with your studies!
