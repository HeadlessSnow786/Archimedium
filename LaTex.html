        Unit 6: Integration and Accumulation of Change
        I. Antiderivatives & Indefinite Integrals
        An antiderivative F of a function f is a differentiable function whose derivative is equal to the original
        function f. If 
        $$F '(x) = f(x)$$
        , then we say that F is an antiderivative of f.

        An indefinite integral of a function f is a family of functions F that are antiderivatives of f.

        $$ \int f(x) dx = F(x) + C1 $$

        C1 represents the constant of integration, which accounts for the entire family of solutions.

        II. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
        The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

        If a function f is continuous on the interval [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f on an interval containing
        [a,b], then

        $$ \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
        $$

        The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states:

        If f is a function continuous on an open interval I containing a, then, for every x in the interval,

        $$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x) $$

        III. Definite Integrals
        The definite integral of a function f from a to b is the signed area between the x-axis and the graph of the
        function from x=a to x=b.

        $$ \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

        Note: If f(x) is greater than 0 for all x in the interval [a,b], then $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is the exact area under
        the curve y=f(x) from x=a to x=b. If f(x) is less than 0, then the "area" is taken as negative.

        Properties of Definite Integrals:

        $\int_a^a f(x) dx = 0$
        $\int_a^b f(x) dx = -\int_b^a f(x) dx$
        $\int_a^b (f(x)±g(x)) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx ± \int_a^b g(x) dx$
        $\int_a^b (cf(x)) dx = c \int_a^b f(x) dx$ (c is a constant)
        IV. Accumulation Functions
        An accumulation function is a function defined by an integral with variable limits:

        $$ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt $$

        where f(t) is a continuous function on an interval I containing a.

        V. Techniques of Integration
        1. Substitution (u-substitution):

        If g’ is continuous on [a,b] and f is continuous on the range of u=g(x), then

        $$ \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) du $$

        It allows us to transform the integral of a complex function into an integral that is easier to evaluate.

        2. Integration By Parts:

        $$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$

        It is useful when the integral is a product of two functions; one that is easily integrable after
        differentiation and another that simplifies upon differentiation.

        3. Partial Fractions:

        When integrating a rational function, where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the
        denominator, it can be useful to express the integrand as a sum of partial fractions. You can then integrate
        term by term.

        VI. Improper Integrals
        An improper integral is the limit of a definite integral as an endpoint of the interval of integration
        approaches either a specified real number, or ∞, or −∞. It can also be due to discontinuities in the function.

        Example:

        $$ \int_a^∞ f(x) dx = \lim_{b\to∞} \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

        For this to be defined, the limit must exist.

        These are the primary topics for Unit 6. Be sure to practice a variety of problems dealing with each type of
        integration in order to cement your understanding. Good luck with your studies!
